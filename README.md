# New Zealand UFO Sightings

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alpha-beta-soup/nz-ufo-sightings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alpha-beta-soup/nz-ufo-sightings)

A Python scraper for UFOCUS NZ UFO sightings, and a MapBox/Leaflet map that then displays the . scraped data. Parses with BeautifulSoup4, tentatively uses pandas, and geocodes pretty poorly with geopy (Neonatim). If you use this tool to extract the information into a friendly format, bear in mind that you must not redistribute that content without the express permission of UFOCUS NZ.

# Disclaimer

The data that this scraper scrapes is © [UFO Focus New Zealand Research Network](http://www.ufocusnz.org.nz/) (UFOCUS NZ) 2015. I have **not** asked their permission, but I am **not** redistributing any of UFOCUS' content—merely using it for private enjoyment. This is a tool that allows individuals to view the information that UFOCUS presents on their website in a slightly different format. I am not redistributing any of that content without UFOCUS' permission. If someone else chooses to use this tool to distribute content that that person does not hold copyight for, I cannot be held liable for that.
