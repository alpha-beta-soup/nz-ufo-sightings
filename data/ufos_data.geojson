As the twin-engine propeller plane flew over Kaipara Harbour, a broad estuary 100 kilometres (60 miles) northwest of Auckland, the pilot, Captain Cathie, spotted an unusual gleam in the water below.He was about 1/3 of the way across Kaipara Harbour, and he at first believed the object to be stranded grey-white whale in an estuary. As he veered his DC-3 for a closer look at the object, it became evident to him that he was observing a metallic structure of some sort.Capt. Cathie noted that the object was perfectly streamlined and symmetrical in shape. It had no visible external control surfaces or protrusions, and appeared metallic with the suggestion of a cap, hatch, or dome on top. It was resting on the bottom of the estuary at a depth of no more than 30 feet of water. It was not shaped like a normal submarine, but was approximately 100 feet in length with an approximate diameter of 15 feet at its widest part.After he filed his flight report, the Royal New Zealand Navy told Captain Cathie that it would have been impossible for any known model of submarine to have been in that particular area, due to the configuration of harbour and coastline.************************************More USO sightings:Throughout the 1940s and 1950s a new and peculiar type of unidentified object, the \u2018USO\u2019 (unidentified submerged object) was sighted around the world - particularly by pilots and seafarers.Around dawn on 28 July 1962, off Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, several crew members and the Captain of a fishing boat were unsettled by mysterious lights that appeared below the surface. They approached the strange glow as something surfaced, and as they came closer, the Captain observed through binoculars and was amazed to see what appeared to be several men now working on a submarine-like object. The sub had no markings whatsoever and was grey in colour. Protruding from the top of the object was a strange structure with a light on it, which the men appeared to be tampering with for a short time before retreating inside the object. The Captain stated, \u201cWe passed abeam about a quarter of mile, and I was certain it was a submarine.\u201dSuddenly, the unmarked object sped towards the fishing boat and then swept past at speed. At that time, the crew believed it may have been a Russian submarine, but this was never confirmed.", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand", "source": "http://www.ufocusnz.org.nz/content/1965---Unidentified-Submerged-Object-%28USO%29-spotted-by-DC-3-Pilot/82.aspx", "location": "Kaipara Harbour, North Island", "time": "Unknown", "date": "1965-01-12 00:00:00", "features": "None"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [172.7205727, -43.6024739]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "Conditions clear and calm.

When checking the photos next day, the witness noticed that 2 of the photos had a formation of 3 objects that showed they tracked across approximately 5km of sky in some 15 seconds. The objects were transiting south to north below the cloud base, estimated to be approximately 3000 feet high, and were to the west of New Plymouth. The objects were not sighted visually, or heard, on the 25th April when the photos were taken.Enlarging the photos, the witness could see that the objects did not appear to be aircraft, and they were definitely not birds, bugs or anything the witness had ever seen before.The witness forwarded the photos and pertinent camera data to UFOCUS NZ, seeking clarification as to what the objects may have been. As the objects maintained the same formation in both photos, it was unlikely that the objects were birds or bugs at close range, and initial UFOCUS investigator impressions were that the objects may have been aircraft returning from an ANZAC Day fly-past. However, the time of day did not fit, as the aircraft would have flown in the early morning, and would be back at their base by lunch-time.UFOCUS NZ Comments:As Saturday 25th April was ANZAC Day, the UFOCUS investigator checked with the RNZAF at both Whenuapai and Ohakea, and they advised that they had no military planes or helicopters in the New Plymouth vicinity at around 1720 on that day. Warbirds at Ardmore and Warbirds at New Plymouth advised that all their flying was done early in the day and they did not know of any Warbird aircraft in the New Plymouth area at 1720.  The investigator also checked with Te Kowhai airfield, and was advised that there would have been no aircraft operating from Te Kowhai at that time.These queries covered all options, as the objects in the photos are holding a \"loose battle-type formation\" in both photos, and their positioning does not vary, and thus gave the impression of aircraft in formation.From the estimated 5km the objects travelled in 15 seconds, the objects\u2019 speed was calculated as approximately 1200kph  ( 650 knots), which would suggest that the objects were not conventional aircraft.

First, they needed to wait for their motor to cool down, and to refill the radiator.During this time they observed a light (about the size of a one-dollar coin held at arm\u2019s length) appear to the southeast above the Kaimai Ranges (on their left).  Then in the blink of an eye the light disappeared and reappeared on their right-hand side, to the northwest.

There was no sound associated with the sighting.The light remained stationary, but blinked completely out after about 20 minutes. At that point the witnesses filled the radiator with water and continued on their way.While driving up the Kaimai Ranges towards Hamilton, the witness again saw a white light high up in the sky to their right (in the northwest). He assumed it was now higher in the sky than before because it appeared smaller. He was feeling uneasy and didn\u2019t want to alert or frighten his son.Suddenly something which looked like a square, vividly coloured partial rainbow, shot over the truck and landed in the field beside them.

They noticed how clear the sky was, after the bad weather earlier in the afternoon. One witness then observed a very bright white light moving across the sky at a rapid pace.  He called the other witness's attention to this immediately, as the characteristic of its flight path was not a perfect arc, but fluctuating around (best described as \u2018bobbing\u2019). The light suddenly stopped dead, seemed to \u2018float\u2019 around slightly, reversed direction, made a sudden, erratic course change to the north, then south, and then slowly continued on roughly the same initial flight path before accelerating rapidly to the ENE.  The light was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet, and could have been some 3-4 kilometers distant. Its initial speed was estimated at some 300 knots, and it was traveling on a west to ENE track.

The reporting witness, a Police Officer, stated the aircraft was lower than they normally are on this flight path, but it is not uncommon. What caught the witness\u2019s attention initially was that the jet was fully lit up, all landing lights under the fuselage were illuminated and they commented they had never seen an aircraft lit up like this before when passing over their house.  It did not have its landing gear down as it was climbing in altitude.The witnesses then noticed a large bright orange light/object heading straight towards the right-hand underside of the aircraft, and it looked as if the two would collide. The orange light/object passed underneath the jet at an estimated altitude of around 500 feet and continued in its easterly direction at a constant speed, while the jet kept climbing. The jet was travelling west to east, having departed Auckland airport, and the light/object was on a more north-westerly to east path.The orange light/object was intensely bright, and maintained a constant direction and altitude. The reporting witness stated he is used to aircraft from the airport passing overhead and is very familiar with the Eagle helicopter, and knows different aircraft by the distinctive sounds they make. This light/object made no sound. The light/object appeared to be disc-shaped, but its brightness made this hard to determine whether it was an orb or disc.The witness estimated the speed of the light/object to be approximately 50 km/h and it took some time before it passed out of view. After about 3 minutes the light increased in speed and went out of sight over the New Lynn area.The witness estimated the light/object was approximately 3 to 4 m wide, which he estimated by comparing its size against the fuselage of the aircraft. It was larger than a helicopter.The witness stated:\u201cI keep replaying in my mind why the A30 aircraft was so illuminated at the time, as this was very unusual. I wondered whether this was because the brightness of the object had eliminated the underside of the aircraft, or whether the aircraft had put all its exterior lights on as they had seen the object was nearing them and they were attempting to light up the fuselage so the object would avoid a collision. The (low) altitude of an aircraft this size also surprised me and I thought maybe it had altered its trajectory to avoid a collision.

This went on for some time, and I was trying hard to concentrate on the driving, as it was dark and the road is winding. I was trying not to say anything that would frighten my daughter. As we went up a cutting, it disappeared behind a hill, and as we drove around the hillside, it caught up with us again from the other side and appeared straight out in front of us. The glow from the object illuminated the entire gully and lit up all the pine trees.Fearing for our safety, I thought to myself that if we got to the next house and we could still see the object, I would go into the farmhouse. When we got to the farm, we looked back and couldn\u2019t see the light any more, so we continued driving on down the road thinking it had gone. However when we looked, there was the light again. It seemed as if it had somehow read our minds, or \u2018knew\u2019 we were afraid, because now it suddenly stayed further away from us, over the ridges of the hills between the Waihopai and Wairau valleys. But it still followed us at a distance for a full half hour all the way down the valley towards Blenheim. We continued driving out of the valley and the object stayed hovering over the hills until we eventually lost sight of it.For the following two or three days my daughter was sick with headaches, sore eyes and nausea, with a lack of appetite. I did not have these symptoms and I can only put this down to the fact that I was driving and concentrating on the road, whereas she was watching the very bright object, sometimes quite close, for most of the journey. We did not have any missing time. After this event, I rang a helicopter pilot who flies in the Waihopai Valley a lot and he said it would have been too dark to have been flying a helicopter in the valley at that time.\"More sightings up the Waihopai Valley in 2008:Click Here[Link to Sightings 2008 Spray River sighting]Back to top", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Waihopai Valley, Marlborough, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2005/43.aspx", "location": "Waihopai Valley, Marlborough, South Island", "time": "6.00 - 6.30 am", "date": "2005-07-02 00:00:00", "features": "object with coloured rotating lights follows car"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [176.1269746, -37.7340848]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "On the evening of 13 June 2005, two charter boats were traveling off the coast of Plate Island in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, en route to Port Whakatane; the Enchanter, with one on board, was five kilometres ahead of the Pursuit, with six on board. Around 8.30 pm both skippers watched a large pulsing orb of red light (no radar contact) to the south, as it followed both vessels to Port Whakatane.During a three hour period, a light appeared from the top of the large light and flew off along the coastline traveling east along the Ohope Beach until it was out of sight. The main light, estimated to be about the size of a house, but difficult to ascertain at night, stayed above the Matata area for the rest of the night, according to the Pursuit crew.The seven men on both vessels were very nervous, never having seen such a light before. Both skippers noted that it was traveling at the same speed as their boats. At one time the red light came closer to the Enchanter and then moved away again. This was noted by both skippers, who were in radio contact all the time.When the Enchanter was adjacent to Whale Island, the light was on the coast side of the boat and the light disappeared soon after, but the Pursuit could still see it now nearer to them. They anchored for the remainder of the night on the west side of Whale Island and noted the light moved nearer Matata and they all thought it hovered over the hills above Matata for the remainder of the night.The evening was overcast and cold with light winds. The light was described as being as bright as a red brake light on a car.UFOCUS NZ comment:UFO sightings often occur around the time of seismic or volcanic activity. Matata, the coastal rural area mentioned in this sighting, sits near a major fault line from the Central Plateau volcanic region, and White Island (an active volcano) sits nearby off the Bay of Plenty coastline. In 1987, a major earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale, struck the Bay of Plenty leaving a 7km crack known as 'the Edgecumbe Fault' that opened in the Rangitaiki Plains near Edgecumbe and Matata.In May 2005, shortly before this sighting, floodwaters ravaged the township of Matata, causing landslides and mudslips and destroying many houses.From early February right through to June 2005, hundreds of earthquakes (swarms) occurred near Matata. They were very shallow, between 5 and 10 kilometres deep.These swarms were still occurring at the time of the above sighting.Back to top", "geocode_attempts": "2", "geocoded_to": "Bay Plenty, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2005/43.aspx", "location": "At sea off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, North Island", "time": "8.30 pm, and throughout the night", "date": "2005-06-13 00:00:00", "features": "charter fishing boats followed by red pulsing light"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [176.0755486, -38.6883048]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "The witnesses, 'Sharonn', her mother, and sister, were traveling by car approaching the lakefront in the city of Taupo, arriving from the Napier-Taupo Highway. Being Summer, it was still light, with the sun was just starting to go down. The sky was generally clear, apart from two long, narrow, and clearly defined cloudbanks to the north. There was only a very slight breeze.Sharon's sister drew their attention to an unusual shaped cloud at a low altitude. The whitish 'cloud' was rounded and thicker at one end, tapering off towards the other end like a teardrop turned on its side, or a short comet-like shape. It was in a patch of clear sky between the two layers of clouds. They then spotted another identical 'cloud' some kilometres away from the first, and realized that both the 'clouds' were actually steadily moving directly towards each other - one moving faster than the other in a northeasterly direction towards Taupo, and the other in a southwesterly direction towards the ski resort town of Turangi. Each 'cloud' was moving horizontally, with the rounded end facing forwards, and a short tail behind. Apart from the two distant cloudbanks, there were no other clouds in the sky in that area. They were moving at a speed that was not consistent with the calm weather at the time.The women quickly stopped the car on the Taupo lakefront and used binoculars to observe the 'clouds' more closely. They were able to see a dark shape or object slightly protruding from the rounded front of each 'cloud'. The 'clouds' continued moving slowly across the sky towards one another until one was directly above the other over Lake Taupo. They both hovered stationary in that position for a few seconds. From their place of observation the women described the clouds as being, \"\u2026very close to each other, almost touching - only a tiny gap (visible) between them\". The clouds surrounding the objects did not change size or shape and remained well-defined. The 'cloud' or object moving towards the township of Taupo then began to move off quite quickly and within a few seconds just seemed to suddenly disappear or dematerialize from sight, which the witnesses thought was unusual, considering it was traveling towards them and should have remained visible for some time. The trio observed the other 'cloud' or object for a couple more minutes as it headed steadily away southwest, before it eventually disappeared from view. No sound of aircraft was heard throughout the sighting as one of the 'clouds' approached the observers.The three women were at a loss to explain what they had just seen, but they believed that the 'clouds' or objects were performing/moving in a way that was not typical of either aircraft or normal clouds.Back to top", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Taupo, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2005/43.aspx", "location": "Taupo, North Island", "time": "8pm", "date": "2005-02-08 00:00:00", "features": "fast-moving defined 'clouds' become stationary"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [176.5605821, -39.9910422]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "The witness was 18 at the time, and living at home with her parents on their family farm.The family lived on a small Romney Marsh stud farm a mile from the Waipukurau township. The farm bordered the Tuki Tuki riverbed on the north side, the AMP show grounds on the west side, a neighbour\u2019s farm on the east side, and Mt Herbert Rd on the south side.One night in late June when the witness\u2019s father and brother were returning from the woolshed and were taking their boots off at the back porch, they noticed a very bright white light slowly moving from east to west above the Tuki Tuki River, which was north of their vantage point.The father called out to the witness and her mother, to go out onto the porch and have a look at this strange light. By the time the two women left dinner preparations to get outside, this light had disappeared. They joked with the father, telling him he must have been seeing things, before returning to the kitchen.A few seconds later the farmer and son called out again, and the two women rushed out the door to the porch, to see an amazingly bright light going up the River from east to west. As it was disappearing from view, it gained altitude and then turned to come at a fast pace directly towards the farmhouse. The witness started screaming to her father, asking him what on earth could be about to happen to them, and asking whether they should leave the house in case we were killed by this object.However, as the object lost altitude, they realized that it was not going to land on their house, but it came down between the cowshed and a line of pine trees by the home boundary fence \u2013 approximately 50 yards away.The object within the light was now clearly visible. A small silver-grey saucer-shaped object, about the length of a car in width, came to a halt and hovered about 20ft from the ground over the lambing paddock, very close to where the dog kennels were positioned on the other side of the trees. It was emitting a very bright light that lit up the entire 2 four acre paddocks, which were divided by a line of pine trees running from the farm boundary to the Tuki Tuki river bed. The object lit up these 2 large paddocks as if it was broad daylight. The sheep grazed unperturbed, but the dogs went absolutely berserk and howled like they had never been heard to howl before. They leapt and strained on the end of their chains trying to get away. (The witness has since wondered if the object was giving off a high pitched sound that was beyond human hearing range, but clearly audible to the dogs\u2019 sensitive hearing.)The witness was absolutely traumatized with fear, pleading with her father to help explain what was going on. However she soon noticed that her father, mother and brother seemed to be transfixed on the spot, whilst she hid behind her father. She recalls them just standing perfectly still, without any movement, reaction or conversation. In those moments, she felt very afraid and alone.The witness described the eerie silence from this object as perplexing, and that the air around the family felt as if it was somehow \u201cpressing down\u201d on her. She was terrified that someone was going to take them away, but the object just hovered there. After a few minutes, it took off in an upwards movement, lighting up all the banks of cloud until it appeared to be moon-sized, then took off at great speed, in fact \u201cin a flash\u201d, due east. It then suddenly stopped and hovered, and in a flash, moved due north and disappeared.When the witness\u2019s family regained their senses, they were amazed by what they could recall of the incident, but were not shocked like the witness herself, who had remained \u2018conscious\u2019 throughout the event. She was the only one who shook uncontrollably for several hours and had a severe headache which did not subside until the next day.After this experience, the father swore the family to secrecy, and they were not allowed to mention any of it to anyone for fear of becoming the laughing stock of the community. However some time afterwards, the father took his daughter into his confidence and told her that he had seen unusual things in the sky before and said that he would show her some of them in daylight.True to his word, on another occasion they saw similar objects sitting above the horizon of the hills that were part of the neighbour\u2019s farm. On this occasion, there were three metallic-looking objects visible that were hovering tilted on an angle, amidst the clouds.

It was late afternoon, around 4:30 p.m. and I was heading back to the station buildings. There was plenty of sunshine and the sky was cloudless with no wind. I came through a gate on horseback with a team of four dogs and we moved onto the farm road high up on a hill. Suddenly, all the dogs \u2018stopped dead\u2019 in the middle of the road, just staring straight ahead with all the hair on their backs standing on end; all the barking and running about ceased. I was thinking this was odd when the horse came to a standstill as well, with its clipped mane standing on end - all 5 inches plus! I couldn't work out what was going on! They just stood there like statues - no barking or movement of any kind. There were no muscles twitching on the horse\u2019s neck and flanks. Then it hit me that I could no longer move my body either! I was sitting there on horseback, completely paralyzed, with the exception of slight eye and head movement. I couldn't move my body or limbs, and like the dogs, I couldn't make any sound. It was absolutely terrifying.Then, I saw what was happening! Straight down the valley ahead of us over a low ridge- line about a quarter of a mile off, was a jet black, cone-shaped flying object with flashing lights rotating around its edges: red, blue, and white. One light would be red, then it would change to blue, then white. The bottom of the object was curved like a shallow bowl. It was at least 50 feet across in width and maybe twenty feet in height from the base to the top of the cone. I could see it as clear as a bell! It had no windows or portholes that I could see, and it resembled those tops that kids used to play with. The horse and dogs never moved a muscle the whole time I was watching it - it was as if they didn't even breathe.I had a panoramic view from my position. Initially, I was looking down on the object as it was moving down the valley towards us, but eventually it moved up higher over the hill-line, so I was able to observe it from different angles as it moved about out in front of me. The object\u2019s flight path was as follows: it moved up a ridge line and hovered at the top of the hill. It then moved along the hill line about 1000 yards or more and stopped. It hovered there without moving or making any sound, but the coloured lights kept flashing around its edges in a sequence. It traveled down another ridge line, stopped dead in its tracks and hovered there. It then elevated some 500 feet or so straight up into the air above the hill and hovered there without moving. Suddenly it just shot off up into the sky on an upward curved flight path, heading south out over the sea. I have never seen anything move so fast, from zero to hundreds of miles an hour in seconds, without making any sound at all.About then, the horse, dogs and I all \u2018came back to life\u2019 and started to move again as if we had been released from a \u2018hold\u2019. To me, it was an extremely frightening experience. I know very well that this thing - this craft - was not of this world. Nothing in this world that I know of flies or moves in this way without making a great amount of noise. This craft was controlled by someone or something.The time period that I watched this craft would have been five to 10 minutes - just sitting there unable to move. It was not a helicopter. A helicopter cannot control its flight like this craft did. The speed acceleration from zero to hundreds of miles an hour in seconds, without noise, was incredible. This craft did not rotate or change its angle of flight position (turn on its side, etc) during the whole time that it was moving up and down the ridge lines; it was under full control.At first I did not tell the station owner and workers, or anyone else about this incident for fear of ridicule. However two weeks later, we noticed that a small Hereford bull had disappeared from the station and it was then that I told them what I had experienced. The bull had been in a paddock with a herd of Angus cows, situated at least a quarter of a mile from the road, over a small river and out of sight. Nobody except the farm employees would have known that it was there. I spent three days riding around the station on horse- back looking for it, and so did the owner. Not a hair of it was found. The bull didn't just go walkabout as he had too many cows to keep him happy! I have often wondered whether the bull was taken by this craft - perhaps in the same paralyzed state that the animals and I had been in.This incident is as clear in my mind now as it was on that day - the memory has never left me. I know to this day what I saw. I think it was a craft from another world - a \u2018UFO\u2019 - it was like a passing \u2018moment\u2019 in time where everything stood still.L.W.Former sheep station worker.UFOCUS NZ comment:For more info on unusual shaped craft visit:http://www.uforth.com/Scroll down to conical hat, bell, cone, & diamond shaped craft.Artist's impression of craft, confirmed as accurate by the witness.", "geocode_attempts": "2", "geocoded_to": "Kiwi Valley Road, Wairoa, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand", "source": "http://www.ufocusnz.org.nz/content/Selection-of-Historic-Sighting-Reports/109.aspx", "location": "Ohinepaka, south of Wairoa, Hawkes Bay, North Island.", "time": "Approx 4.30 p.m., late afternoon", "date": "1971-08-31 00:00:00", "features": "cone or top-shaped object with flashing lights; paralysis"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [175.7073602, -36.8296474]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "Three sightings were made by the observers, approximately 5 minutes apart.

The discs appeared between the size of five and ten cent coins held at arm\u2019s length. They do not recall if there were any windows in any of the craft, but commented that the cylindrical object left a shimmering trail behind it.

One of the Officers looked at it through binoculars, but did not comment whether there was a definite shape or if it was a single craft. There was no sound. It is difficult to say whether it was a single vehicle or a group in the night sky. It had all the hallmarks of being One Massive Object, as the power source came from the outer extremities of what could be described as a boomerang configuration and there was a fixed light at the leading edge. The power source at these extremities left almost indelible bright 'contrails' across the sky from horizon to horizon, and took some five to ten minutes to dissipate!\"\"If it had been a conventional aircraft, then in relation to size, the spread of the power sources (engines) would have meant that it would have needed to be flying at mast height, and therefore deafening us with the noise from the engines!If not a conventional aircraft\u2026and if it were all one craft (a single object), then it was COLLOSSAL! It took a full five minutes to go from first starboard sighting to our port side horizon. There was silence\u2026. and the light emitted from directly behind the power source appeared effervescent before forming into a straight beam of light, which stretched across the entire sky. It was awe inspiring!\"\"The sighting was never placed in the ships log as we thought that no one would ever believe us and we did not want to be the subjects of ridicule. We knew that there was a ship about 100 nautical miles to our starboard and which we contacted by radio, but they did not report anything unusual.

She was not normally scared by such things, but on this occasion she recalls that her hair 'stood on end' and something did not 'feel right'. Fifteen minutes later, while herding the cows up the track, she observed a strange 'creature' in the headlight, lying in the hayrack.

She was adamant it was not a dog, cat or possum.She then sighted a solid black cylindrical object near the centre of the next paddock.

As he was doing this he saw a second small white light appear to the right of the larger light and start moving down and to the west at about a 45\u00b0 angle. The witness\u2019s wife came out to watch and as he was pointing towards the lights, a third small white light appeared below the original and headed west towards the other two small lights. By now the original light had faded somewhat and the other three smaller lights were already hard to spot as they now headed southwest, maintaining a changing triangular formation.The original orange/red light faded out completely over distance, and the witness lost track of the other three as he tried to explain to his wife what he had been observing. He stayed outside from another five minutes but did not spot the lights again.The witness also stated that this was the third time in the last two months he had seen unusual lights in the sky. Prior to the last two months, he had never seen anything in the sky he could not explain as being an aircraft, satellite, or natural phenomenon.Witness's diagram showing movement of the 4 lightsBack to top", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Waitarere Beach, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2011/131.aspx", "location": "Waitarere Beach, Levin, North Island", "time": "approx 9.45 pm", "date": "2011-01-31 00:00:00", "features": "large orange/red light; three small white lights forming triangular formation"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [174.7601654, -36.4531842]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "A large intensely bright red light was observed on a clear night by some 10-12 people as it traveled along the East Coast between Kauwau Island and North of the Whangaparoaoa Peninsula, at an altitude of approximately a kilometre.

Duration of sighting three to four seconds.The witness lives in the north-west side of Cambridge and was observing the night sky, wondering if he was going to see any shooting stars that evening.He was facing north when he observed three distinctive triangular objects moving very fast overhead. The sky was cloudless, the Milky Way was clearly visible, and the objects came into view travelling in a northerly direction.What made this sighting unusual was the speed at which the objects were travelling, not as fast as a shooting star, but much faster than any aircraft he had seen from that viewing position before. There was no sound from the three objects, however the witness could see and hear aircraft over Hamilton International Airport to the west. This factor reinforced the witness's initial thoughts that what he had just seen were not aircraft (by comparing sight and sounds).The three objects were each approximately the size of his index finger held out at arm\u2019s length (approximately 1 cm wide in the sky), and all three were uniform in triangular size and brightness throughout the sighting.The objects were nearly as bright as a full moon, and were dullish grey in colour, with whiter coloured edges. There were no trails from behind them.It was initially thought the objects could have been RAAF jets returning from Ohakea Airbase to Whenuapai Airbase, but the light patterns did not conform to that of any aircraft tracking in a northerly direction. Our UFOCUS NZ investigator interviewed the witness on site, and estimated the objects appeared at approximately 55 to 60\u00b0 above the horizon, and were lost from sight approximately 20\u00b0 above the horizon on a steady south-north track. The objects maintained a steady illumination, and were eventually blocked from the witness\u2019s view by a tree. It was not possible to estimate the height of the objects, however, for them to have a distinctly discernible triangular shape, their height would have been dependent on their relative size.What made this sighting even more unusual was the triangular formation of the three triangular-shaped objects. Two of the objects were flying side by side in front, and the third was initially in the middle behind, but within the time they were viewed, the rear object made an exaggerated reverse \u2018S\u2019 flight pattern before resuming the same triangular formulation behind the other two objects.The witness has spent many hours viewing the sky at night and is familiar with movement of shooting stars/satellites, as well as aircraft approaching and leaving Hamilton International Airport.

The witness watched it briefly and then called another witness from inside the house to video the light (captured on digital camera). After 30 seconds or so, the light began to move around above the hill, changing direction frequently. Two other lights began to flash on the underside forming a triangular shape in the sky, two bright yellow/white and one orange.

The companions travelled out through Upper Hutt, over the Rimutaka Ranges, and then proceeded through Featherston into the Martinborough area.

The light initially appeared to be oval in shape, but its shape then became distorted or fuzzy. As the witnesses drew closer to the hills, the light moved and suddenly appeared very close to them, almost over them at one stage, before returning back to its original position at approximately 30-35 degrees above the ranges. They noticed that there was no sound accompanying the movement of the light close to them. The witnesses described the light as having soft hues that appeared to glow. They described the size of the light as 'substantial'.The light remained in view for approximately another 20-25 minutes until the men drove over the ranges and down the other side towards Featherstone. At this stage they lost sight of the light because of the close proximity of hill ridgelines (see Map 1). The men continued on their way discussing what they had seen.

Once settled in the maimai, the witnesses were facing in a southwesterly direction overlooking the lake, waiting for ducks to show up! The sun had not yet risen.Shortly after 6 pm, the men noticed a glow behind a hill some 12 kms distant (an estimate). (The hill is called Maunganui; see Map 2).

The light was moving very slowly in a northerly direction (away from the observer, and slightly to the right in his field of vision).He quickly got out his camera to get a closer view, to ascertain whether it could be a bright star or planet (there were no other stars visible in the sky). Using the zoom setting he saw that the unusual light or object appeared oval in shape. He observed it for approximately 4 \u00bd minutes during which time he took a series of eight photos. The witness did not hear any sound.The witness sighted the object very close to the time that the sun set over the headland. There was still some light in the sky, and the moon was rising in the east at the time of the sighting. The object is certainly not a cloud. Carter Observatory has confirmed exact sunset time in relation to the time the photos were taken.The photos were taken using a Sony digital camera, model DSC-F828. When the witness viewed the photos on his computer, he saw distinct images. The object\u2019s shape or angle of movement appeared to alter slightly as it moved further away, as seen in each photo, although the movement was almost imperceptible to the witness at the time of sighting.The photos have been examined by an overseas optical data analyst who noted that the shapes in the images are most unusual, and could possibly be consistent with a jet contrail viewed \u2018end on\u2019.However ATC has confirmed there were no scheduled flights in that area at that time. ATC has stated that if it were a contrail, they would expect to see consistency of shape from both trails, and a \u2018flow-off\u2019 similar to a cirrus cloud, if blown by winds. The shapes in the photographs are compact.The analyst stated that although the object or shape appeared to be moving slowly from the witness\u2019s point of view, the object could have been traveling rapidly but seen from the rear, its speed was not apparent. He also stated that while the object did not display flight characteristics at the time of photographing that would necessarily distinguish it as a \u2018craft\u2019 of unknown origin, the shape of the image certainly suggests a circular \u2018something\u2019 with a dome-like top.Both UFOCUS NZ and the analyst agree that no firm conclusion can been reached as to what this strange object is at present, and it is classified as an unusual aerial phenomenon (UAP).However, following enquiries and media articles on the sighting, UFOCUS NZ received sighting reports from two other people who were fishing at Ahipara Beach on the same day as this sighting (April 28), who also observed and photographed the light. They stated they arrived at local Fishing Club premises to attend a meeting just before dusk. As they came over the rise near the clubrooms, they were confronted by an unusual sight out in front of them over the sea. They observed an oval silver-grey object in close to shore, which was moving away from them and giving off a glow or light. As the object moved away, it appeared as a large light in the sky. The two witnesses went into the clubrooms and asked other members of the fishing club to come out and look at the light as it receded into the distance.

At approximately 8am on a fine morning when the sun was just clearing the hills, a farming couple witnessed a solid metallic craft, moving up a valley on their farm. The farm is situated to the west of Hamilton in an area from which other sightings of UFOs/UAPs have also been reported over previous years.The husband saw the craft first over the woolshed, and called to his wife to come and see it. They both watched the craft until it disappeared up the valley.When interviewed independently by UFOCUS NZ, both the farmer and his wife were specific about the size and shape of the craft, which was \u2018egg-shaped\u2019 or 'bullet-shaped'.The witnesses described the craft as being roughly cylindrical, the body being egg or bullet-shaped with pointed ends. It was bright metallic silver, and the wife was adamant it had several oval-shaped windows evenly spaced, although the husband did not recall if it had windows. The object had horizontal wings, but no tail. It was not an aircraft. They commented on how bright and shiny it looked in the morning sun, and how it emitted a sound like a 'whisper jet\u2019. The object moved quite slowly and silently up the valley close to ground level and appeared to be following the creek water course before disappearing behind adjacent hills.The craft was between the far hill in the photograph, which is about 1 mile from the farmhouse, and the wool shed, placing it approximately \u00bd mile from the witnesses. It was very large, with the husband estimating the object\u2019s size as approximately 30 metres in length, some 6 metres in width, with semi-circular (rounded points) ends. The object was bright silver when viewed up close, and changed to a dull red as it disappeared at the end of the valley road.The craft was clearly visible when stationary for a short time at the end of the valley road, some 1 \u00bd - 2 miles away from the observers. The husband has maintained an interest in the subject of ufology over many years, and was of the opinion that the reason for this sighting may be related to the many seismic fault lines that are present locally and in the immediate district. As is the case with many other reported NZ sightings, there appears to be an increase in sightings around the time of seismic and volcanic activity.During the interview, the wife also mentioned seeing large balls of light in 2006, about \u00bd mile away in the valley behind the house. On one occasion, the sky was overcast and it was dusk/night; a bright light was observed below the cloud base, carrying out erratic zig-zag movements as it descended into the valley, brilliantly lighting up the valley between the wool shed and the large distant hill. One of the sightings involved the same type of light hovering in the valley, with two smaller red lights emerging from it and separately making oval patterns before merging back into the larger ball of light.Both witnesses were clear in their sightings details. The husband is a former pilot and is very familiar with aircraft types and shapes. The couple both reported observing UFOs/UAPs in their valley over previous years and these had also been seen by neighbouring farmers, but these sightings were not reported for fear of ridicule.The Waitetuna witness' description of the craft bears a striking resemblance to a report from three witnesses who reported a sighting that took place at Whitianga on 16 February 2003.", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Waitetuna Valley, Waikato, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2007/41.aspx", "location": "Waitetuna Valley, Waikato, North Island", "time": "8 am", "date": "2007-03-26 00:00:00", "features": "silent solid metallic craft"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [176.1673614, -37.6867319]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "There were two witnesses to this sighting, which lasted approx. 5 minutes.

The sky was clear.\"A friend and I were out looking for feral deer with a spotlight. We decided to travel north up the railway line on the way home to National Park Village. We drove past an area where about 80 hectares was burnt in a fire May 2006. The scrub was burnt back to the dirt and swampy waterways pass through the area, although at this time, it was quite dry. As we crossed the main trunk line, my friend mentioned we had company! Looking back down the burn around what I guessed to be 80 metres, (on or near the ground) was a strange display of lights: 4 very bright red/orange lights (like embers) evenly spaced, and a larger single yellowish light below. My friend said it must be a vehicle. I know this area well (rugged), and said nobody in a vehicle would even consider entering the area! He then said it must be a fire, because the lights were glowing like embers. I said it wasn't a fire, and thought maybe it was a tent with lights inside it. So to end this debate, I jumped out of the Hilux to put the spotlight on this unknown object (the spotlight unplugged as I exited the Hilux). It then just took off and made an extremely swift exit in a southerly direction at very low altitude, with no noise, and then the lights just vanished!The next day we went back to the location and had a search, but couldn't find anything out of the ordinary in the area where this object was stationary. It was in a little dip obscured from view from nearby National Park Village homes. 100m south west of where the object had been is a railway power substation, and National Park Village is about 500m north of the area. I keep going over and over what we saw, but can't make any sense of it. My friend thought people would think we were mad if we reported it.

As well as travelling at extreme speed, moving erratically, and performing acute angled turns, UFOs are also often described as \u2018wobbling\u2019, \u2018fluttering\u2019 and descending with a \u2018swinging\u2019 movement (like a falling leaf).The witness provided a detailed diagram of the event.The anomalous lights are unlikely to have been flares \u2013 flares do not create erratic lights and movements.They are highly unlikely to have been military activity \u2013 such activities usually take place between 0800 and 1700.Movements and lighting characteristics of the anomalous lights observed do not correlate to those of aircraft.The witness's description of the path of the jet coincides with early morning inbound flights from Honolulu/LA/Vancouver/Samoa. He is correct in saying that he could see the landing lights - an inbound aircraft on these routes for a landing at Auckland would have landing lights on as it crossed the Coromandel Peninsula.It would be interesting to know whether the aircrew of the jet sighted the anomalous lights.Witness's diagram using Google image, looking up the Firth of Thames towards the Northern ranges of the Coromandel Peninsula.", "geocode_attempts": "3", "geocoded_to": "Firth Thames, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2009/38.aspx", "location": "Coromandel Peninsula & Firth of Thames, North Island", "time": "4.55 am", "date": "2009-06-03 00:00:00", "features": "anomalous strobing light; square configuration of 5 lights"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [175.544443, -37.1366455]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "Duration of sighting approximately 1 \u00bd minutes.

The object was a bright white oval (egg) shape and was either stationary or moving very slowly.

Clear skies with plenty of stars, but no moon.Two witnesses, a husband and wife, were travelling home from Hamilton towards Cambridge, along Marychurch Road/State Highway 1b. As they passed through the intersection of Marychurch Road and Church Road, they could see a bright light off to their left (to the east). The light was stationary, very bright, and a clean white/ blue light (relative to other light expected to be seen in a rural situation at night), and seemed to be too high to be a street light being above treetop height. It was positioned 60m or more above the ground, and was 400-500m away from the witnesses. (The witnesses visited the area the next day, and discovered that the light had actually been hovering over a paddock.)Initially, the couple discussed the possibility that the light was a new street light that may have had been installed at the Church Road/Victoria Road intersection, which was higher than the norm. However, as they progressed down Marychurch Road, it became clear that it simply couldn't be a street light. They continued down Marychurch Road, passing behind groups of trees, and the light was temporarily out of sight a few times. As they neared the end of Marychurch Road, the single light appeared to split into two lights. The witnesses were uncertain as to whether this was because a second light had been obscured by a light in front, or whether the initial single light had literally split into two lights.They passed behind another group of trees (which took no more than a second or two), and as they came out from behind them, they could see that the two lights were at least 2 to 3 km away and dwindling into the distance. The witnesses then lost sight of them as their car passed behind a final tree. They paused near a railway crossing to look at where the lights had gone. As they looked in the direction that the lights had headed, they saw a bright flash of light, almost akin in both colour and effect, to an extremely large camera flash, that occurred in the surrounding hills approximately 10 km to the east.The witnesses sat and discussed the events. The wife wished to go home, as she was in awe and shock. The husband describes himself as a cynic, and until this point had never believed in any form of extraterrestrial activity, and of course wanted to prove that there was a reasonable and natural explanation for what they had seen. So the couple did a loop around the block and approached the area from Victoria Road - but there was nothing to see other than a very normal street light at the Victoria Road/Church Road intersection. It was neither new nor unusually high and was a typical yellow tone, much different from the lights they had just witnessed.The witnesses then retraced their steps from the Mary Church/Church Road intersection and saw absolutely nothing.\u201cNo lights, no farmers out with flares (which had been one thing I thought it may have been), no sign of anything unusual at all, which has cast some doubts in my usually cynical mind.\u201d(husband)The initial light appeared to be airborne and stationary for the first 50 seconds of the sighting, hovering approximately 60-100m above the ground. The two lights traveled from their initial position to around 3 kilometres away within seconds, heading rapidly in an easterly direction. The witnesses saw the huge flash of light over easterly hills about 15 seconds after they lost sight of the lights due to passing briefly behind a tree.See similar sighting \u2013 Sunday 15 March 2009.UFOCUS NZ comment:In 1978, at the time of the \u2018Kaikoura lights\u2019 sightings, a TV1 news film crew filmed a large bright white light that split into two lights, each light moving off independently.

They were in the sky slightly above the mountain and were visible for 10-20 seconds,\u201dafter which the lights moved away and downwards behind the ranges (to the Katikati, Bay of Plenty side). The witnesses stated these lights were not to be confused with the small red light on top of the aerial on Mount Te Aroha.Only seconds after this sighting the witnesses looked across the sky and observed 3 small white lights in a triangular formation. They described the speed of this formation of lights as similar to the speed of a satellite (quite slow). The lights were heading from the direction of the city of Hamilton, in a northerly direction towards the mountain, where the two bright pink lights were seen. The witnesses guessed the lights must be 3 aircraft high in the sky travelling close together in formation. They watched the lights for 2-3 minutes until they disappeared from view beyond the ranges where the two pink lights had disappeared. The witnesses rang the Te Aroha Police Station, and the Operations Manager at Hamilton International Airport, however no explanations were offered. They also rang the Te Aroha Information Centre on Monday, without results.Having no logical explanation, the witnesses thought the pink lights must have been flares, although the lights they observed were much bigger than flares.

One of the witnesses observed that the glow of the light actually \u201cwent out\u201d and he saw a dark coloured object in the sky before it disappeared into the distance. This was not observed by the other witness, whose view at that point was blocked by branches. Both witnesses state that the quality of the photos does not do justice to the brightness and \u2018strangeness\u2019 of the light, and the overall event.The photos were taken on a Lumix LX3 camera, on an automatic setting. There is very little camera blur or movement in most of the photos (branches and shrubbery in the foreground are clear), although some \u2018elongation\u2019 of the light does occur in several photos, indicating some hand-held camera movement and shutter pressure. The photos posted below are enlargements of the light only, however the original photos show a tree and a cloud bank as reference points, which illustrate the movement of the light in the sky and into the distance throughout the series of photos, in relation to the reference points. We have omitted the last photo due to space \u2013 the light is barely visible in this photo.The 17 photos were taken in the following intervals of seconds:6, 3, 4, 5, 3, 12, 2, 5, 2, 3, 4, 2, 38, 4, 5, 25.UFOCUS NZ Comment:As an aircraft performs a turn, the landing lights diminish until no longer visible. However in this case, the intensity of the light did not diminish following the acute turn. The light only diminished as it receded into the distance.

The reporting witness stated the aircraft was lower than they normally are on this flight path, but it is not uncommon. What caught the witness\u2019s attention initially was that the jet was fully lit up, all landing lights under the fuselage were illuminated and they commented they had never seen an aircraft lit up like this before when passing over their house.  It did not have its landing gear down as it was climbing in altitude.The witnesses then noticed a large intensely bright orange light/object heading straight towards the right-hand underside of the aircraft, and it looked as if the two would collide. The orange light/object passed underneath the jet at an altitude of around 500 feet and continued in its easterly direction, not gaining any speed, while the jet kept climbing. The jet was travelling west to east, having departed Auckland airport, and the object was on a more north-westerly to east path.The orange light/object was intensely bright, and maintained a constant direction and altitude. The reporting witness stated he is used to aircraft from the airport passing overhead and is very familiar with the Eagle helicopter, and knows different aircraft by the distinctive sounds they make. This light/object made no sound. The light/object appeared to be disc-shaped, but its brightness made this hard to determine whether it was an orb or disc.The reporting witness estimated the speed of the light/object to be approximately 50 km/h and it took some time before it passed out of view. After about 3 minutes the light increased in speed and went out of sight over the New Lynn area towards the CBD.The witness estimated the light was approximately 3 to 4 m wide (about the size of a small aircraft), which he estimated by comparing its size against the fuselage of the aircraft.The witness stated: \u201cI keep replaying in my mind why the A30 aircraft was so illuminated at the time, as this was very unusual. I wondered whether this was because the brightness of the object had eliminated the underside of the aircraft, or whether the aircraft had put all its exterior lights on as they had seen the object was nearing them and they were attempting to light up the fuselage so the object would avoid a collision. The (low) altitude of an aircraft this size also surprised me and I thought maybe it had altered its trajectory to avoid a collision.

While the wife prepared an evening meal, the man went for a walk down the path near the river. It was just on twilight with two or three stars visible and a few clouds. \u201c After walking about 200 metres I entered an area of bushes and trees and was surprised to see what I thought were two small children about 50 metres in front of me, who quickly crossed the path and entered some bushes that lead down towards the river. Suddenly a bright light, somewhere down where the children had run to, took off like a bullet into the air at an angle and disappeared into the twilight sky in what must have been less than a second. Whatever it was, it traveled at the speed of a tracer bullet. There was a slight swishing sound and the trees and bushes rustled briefly. I would estimate the light, which was yellowish, to be 10 to 15 feet in diameter.This shook me up a bit and the adrenalin was pumping. I turned and made my way back to the camper van and told my wife what I had seen. We both decided to spend the night elsewhere.We parked up five or 6 km down the main road and discussed the event for some time before retiring. The next morning, we discussed the subject again for a while before deciding to drop it. We actually discussed it again when we reached Kaikoura, because of the things that were seen in the sky from there, some years ago.I have no idea what it was I saw that evening, but it may be significant that it was only a couple of days before Guy Fawkes. I refuse to believe that I saw some sort of a spaceship. Those sorts of things belong in the Hollywood movies. There has to be some explanation, and I am hoping that you good people can give me one.\u201dUFOCUS NZ comment:some considerable discussion took place over E-mail between this observer and UFOCUS NZ. His description did fit the characteristics of common possible causes of the light such as: a helicopter, ball lightning, meteor, missile, laser, or a spotlight. Nor would fireworks fit his description of a sphere of light some 10 to 15 feet in diameter, moving at exceptional speed into the sky and disappearing, and causing the trees and bushes to rustle.We asked a series of investigative questions pertaining to: the light, the children, their safety, occupants of any other cars, caravans or houses in the area, and why the observer chose not to check whether the children were alright, and where/what he thought this light may have originated from.The observer did not answer our questions, and felt he was comfortable believing he had observed a laser (although he himself pointed out that laser beams are generally pencil thin, and we questioned what somebody would be doing in such a remote area, with a laser capable of forming a 10-15ft wide, bright, fast moving sphere of light could disappear into the distance in the night sky).It was clear to us that this observer had been severely shaken by this event. He could find no logical explanation for it, however, he expected us to do so. He could not accept that our finding could be \u2018unexplained\u2019 or \u2018unidentified\u2019.Finally, we also suggested a possible scenario to this event, based on international UFO research and sighting reports, that he may have experienced a \u2018close encounter\u2019, however he did not wish to consider that possibility.", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Clarence New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2008/40.aspx", "location": "Clarence River mouth, Lower Marlborough, South Island", "time": "Early evening, just on twilight", "date": "2008-11-03 00:00:00", "features": "two child-like figures; large bright light leaves ground at speed"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [174.4505396, -36.6799207]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "Duration of sighting approx 5 mins; clear sky, excellent visibility.

The sighting lasted approx 1 minute and was reported to UFOCUS NZ within an hour of the occurrence.The sighting took place in a rural farming/viticulture area near Seddon. The witness went outside to feed his dogs at about 10.10 p.m. He noticed what he thought was an unusually bright star or planet to the north east of his house at about 30\u00b0 above the horizon. He stopped to take more notice as he couldn't remember a star or planet this low or this bright before. His initial thoughts were of a spotlight on a vehicle up on the hills, however the light seemed to be positioned higher than where the road would be, for this explanation. It appeared to be about 25 m above the top of a hill. The witness described the size of the light as large, with what looked like a beam of light shining from it. The white light was quite intense and resembled a high-powered spotlight on an aircraft. When the light changed colour to red, and dimmed (beam of light went off/out), it appeared smaller.The light was initially stationary or hovering, but after about 30 seconds of observation, the light dimmed and appeared to recede slightly, before changing to a red flashing light. It then flew off quickly to the south east, eventually disappearing from view in the direction of Cape Campbell. The flight path was not a direct one as one would expect of an aircraft. The path of the light seemed to oscillate or change direction erratically or randomly. The witness stated that from past observations of aircraft, the light moved considerably faster than a commercial airliner.The observer's initial thoughts were that this was possibly a helicopter on some kind of spotlighting mission, but the unusual manner of its flight and its perceived speed, made him suspect otherwise. He commented that usually you can make out the sound of commercial airliners flying overhead, and he felt that if this was indeed a helicopter, then he would probably have heard some noise, as it was a perfectly still and quiet night. However, there was absolutely no noise associated with the sighting. The witness could not work out what an aircraft would be doing in this particular area at this time of night, especially with a spotlight on. He commented that he lives in an area of vineyards, which often have helicopters on frost protection duty, but it was the wrong time of the year for that sort of activity, and the direction of the departure of the light was well away from the vineyards and in the opposite direction to the nearest aerodromes.During the sighting, the witness realized he had a video camera in the car that was parked in front of him. At the moment he thought of moving towards the car to retrieve the camera the light dimmed and headed off into the distance. At the time of writing his initial report the witness thought this was merely coincidental, but after submitting his report, he noticed that some other reports on our website mention this similar factor - that the light seemed to respond in some way to the observer's thoughts.UFOCUS NZ comments:We enquired with Blenheim airport ATC, who advised there were no helicopter flights that they were aware of in that area at the time of the sighting, and they were not aware of any RNZAF activity either.However, helicopters do operate from private fields and ATC would not be aware of their operation, unless they were close to controlled airspace.The erratic movement of the light and its flight path toward Cape Campbell does not coincide with the route of any commercial aircraft flying into/out of Wellington.The flight pattern of the light was more like that of a helicopter, however, the speed of the light was described as faster than a commercial airliner, and the observer stated that it disappeared from view \u201cquite quickly\u201d.Venus was visible in the sky, however, the witness observed this light to shine a beam, dim in intensity, change colour, and move off at speed.Around this time, there were heavy snowfalls up the Awatere Valley further to the southwest of the observer's position, and air force helicopters were used to drop feed to isolated sheep and stock. However, these helicopters would not have been flying at night, and the light viewed by the observer was positioned to the north east and departed in a south easterly direction, towards the coastal lowlands and sea off Clifford Bay/Cape Campbell.", "geocode_attempts": "1", "geocoded_to": "Seddon, New Zealand", "source": "http://ufocus.cyberstore.co.nz/content/New-Zealand-UFO-Sightings-2008/40.aspx", "location": "Seddon, South Island", "time": "10.10 pm", "date": "2008-08-12 00:00:00", "features": "intense white light shines beam of light; changes colour"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [176.8447684, -39.6430115]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "Two witnesses were heading towards 0mahu Road (the main road into Hastings from the Flaxmere area).

They watched as the lights gained speed and traveled parallel to them across the adjacent paddocks above the tree line. They could now make out a dark object shaped like a round 'cake tin' silhouetted against the city lights.

This was at 10:48 p.m. The object was now over the paddocks on the left of the witnesses, and was partly obscured by a row of trees. The driver stopped at the first gap in the trees, and the object was now hovering over what looked like a power pole, just visible in the dark.

He climbed to a vantage point to get a better view.The light was approx. a further 5 kms up the valley. The farmer observed an area of light that he estimated to be approximately one kilometer wide. A light was shining downwards into the valley, lighting it up with bright flashes of light that he described as being like \u201cstars and light\u201d. These flashing lights lit up the entire valley.
